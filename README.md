# MDS Project
Project created for "Metode de dezvoltare software" . Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Bucharest.


# Description of application

Our project is an Android mobile app for food delivery. The app gives you access to our partner restaurants and you can order their goods with just one click.  Imagine how easy it is not to waste your time driving around town to get your food exactly at your desired address. The food will be delivered by our drivers that get your order from your favourite restaurant and bring it to you. Besides our clients interface, delivery drivers have a special interface that gives them the ability to accept or reject deliveries where they can see the orders received with the suitable description.
